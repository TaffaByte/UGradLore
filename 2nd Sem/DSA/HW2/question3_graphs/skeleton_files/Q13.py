    Identifies the best-performing warehouse based on the highest transit trust factor.

    This function iterates through the graph and finds the warehouse with the 
    maximum transit trust value.

    Parameters:
    graph (dict): The supply chain graph represented as an adjacency list, 
                  where each key is a warehouse and its value includes the transit trust factor.

    Returns:
    tuple: The warehouse with the highest transit trust factor. If the graph is empty, returns -1."
