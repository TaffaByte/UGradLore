def count_all_supply_chain_connections(graph, warehouse_o, warehouse_i):
    """
    Finds the count of all connections between the origin and the destination warehouses using DFS.

    Parameters:
    graph (dict): The supply chain graph represented as an adjacency map.
    warehouse_o (str): The alphanumeric warehouse ID of the origin vertex.
    warehouse_i (str): The alphanumeric warehouse ID of the destination vertex.

    Returns:
    int: The count of all paths connecting the two warehouses. 
    If there is no such warehouse in the graph, it returns None
    If both warehouse_o and warehouse_i refer to the same warehouse, then the count should be 0
